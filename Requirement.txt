Abstract/Introduction
This project 
is an Internet based school management site that enables school management to effectively organize school activities.
 This web application will provide a centralized interface to management to monitor student’s status and manage financial fee 
related issues. Separate interfaces with limited access features will be provided to the students and their parents to monitor their
 progress in various subjects.

Admin Interface will be used by school owner/management and its credentials will be shared with owner/management. Through this interface,
 they can create/register various classes, and register the students in corresponding classes. Fee and subjects information for each class
 will also be made through this interface. Afterwards, they will create User account for each student which will be shared with the
 corresponding students/parents. On User Interface, each student can view his/her study progress in various subjects and other fee related
 information. Students/parents can provide feedback through user interface regarding the progress in various tests/exams to the management.

This website project will be developed using ASP.NET / PHP as the front end and SQL Server / MYSQL as a back-end.
 The database will store all information about the students and various other school related information.
